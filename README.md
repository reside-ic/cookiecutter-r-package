# cookiecutter-r-package

A template for a basic R package including:

* our usual lintr template
* github workflows for check (4 platforms), coverage and pkgdown
* docker container built on buildkite
* R and git ignore files

The resulting R package should pass `R CMD check` with no notes, warnings or errors, though you will want to update the metadata in `DESCRIPTION`.

## Instructions
